- Record numbers of solar panels were shipped in the United States during 2021. U.S. shipments of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules (solar panels) rose to a record electricity-generating capacity of 28.8 million peak kilowatts (kW) in 2021, from 21.8 million peak kW in 2020, based on data from our Annual Photovoltaic Module Shipments Report. Continued demand for U.S. solar capacity drove this increase in solar panel shipments in 2021. U.S. solar panel shipments include imports, exports, and domestically produced and shipped panels. In 2021, about 80% of U.S. solar panel module shipments were imports, primarily from Asia. U.S. solar panel shipments closely track domestic solar capacity additions; differences between the two usually result from the lag time between shipment and installation. We categorize solar capacity additions as either utility-scale (facilities with one megawatt of capacity or more) or small-scale (largely residential solar installations). The United States added 13.2 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar capacity in 2021, an annual record and 25% more than the 10.6 GW added in 2020, according to our Annual Electric Generator Report. Additions of utility-scale solar capacity reached a record high, despite project delays, supply chain constraints, and volatile pricing. Small-scale solar capacity installations in the United States increased by 5.4 GW in 2021, up 23% from 2020 (4.4 GW). Most of the small- scale solar capacity added in 2021 was installed on homes. Residential installations totaled more than 3.9 GW in 2021, compared with 2.9 GW in 2020. The cost of solar panels has declined significantly since 2010. The average value (a proxy for price) of panel shipments has decreased from $1.96 per peak kW in 2010 to $0.34 per peak kW in 2021. Despite supply chain constraints and higher material costs in 2021, the average value of solar panels decreased 11% from 2020. In 2021, the top five destination states for U.S. solar panel shipments were: 1. California (5.09 million peak kW) 2. Texas (4.31 million peak kW) 3. Florida (1.80 million peak kW) 4. Georgia (1.15 million peak kW) 5. Illinois (1.12 million peak kW) These five states accounted for 46% of all U.S. shipments.

On September 6, a new record was set in the California Independent System Operator’s (CAISO) territory. CAISO, the grid operator for most of the state, issued appeals for consumer energy conservation throughout the week, as well as Energy Emergency Alerts each day, to help reduce electricity demand and prevent rolling power outages. CAISO predominately used natural gas, electricity imports, and hydroelectric sources during the highest demand hours to meet the record-breaking demand, which was a change from the typical mix. For brief periods during the week of September 4, CAISO used natural gas for as much as 60%—and never less than 30%—of the generation mix to meet electricity demand. California typically uses a mix of solar, wind, imports, hydroelectric, and natural gas sources for electricity generation. The exact mix depends on the time of day, the availability of sources, and the price that power plants set to sell electricity to the grid. This year, up to the record-setting demand week in September, CAISO’s generation mix included: 40% from solar, wind, nuclear, batteries, and other sources 32% from natural gas 20% from imports 7% from hydroelectric The mix relies slightly more on natural gas during the evening hours from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., when electricity demand peaks and solar generation wanes. During the week of September 4, 2022, however, natural gas contributed nearly one-half of the resource mix in CAISO; nuclear, solar, wind, batteries, and other resources decreased to a 24% share. In California, natural gas units are often the last resource turned on to meet demand because they can be turned on after the sun sets in the evening when cooling demand remains high. When demand reaches record highs, seldom-used (less efficient, more expensive) natural gas units are needed to meet demand. 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% ...the week of Sep 4 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m....this year CAISO's electricity generation mix so far...

- In 2020, 3.7% of U.S. single-family homes, including mobile homes, generated electricity from small-scale solar systems (solar panels installed on a home or building), according to our 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). In 2018, 1.6% of U.S. commercial buildings had small-scale solar generation, according to our 2018 Commercial Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). The presence of small-scale solar generation varied by a number of characteristics. Some of the largest differences were based on region. The West Census Region, where 8.9% of single-family homes (2020 data) had small-scale solar generation, had the highest percentage of homes with small-scale solar generation, mostly in California. Of commercial buildings in the West, 3.8% (48,000) had small-scale solar generation (2018 data). The Northeast Census Region had the second-largest percentage of homes with small-scale solar generation at 4.7% (2020 data). Similarly, for commercial buildings, 2.5% (20,000) had small-scale solar generation (2018 data). These two regions generally have had policies and incentives that have fostered growth of small-scale solar

Question:
Is small-scale solar growing? How much is it adding?

Answer:
Yes, it's growing. Record numbers of solar panels were shipped in the United States during 2021. U.S. shipments of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules (solar panels) rose to a record electricity-generating capacity of 28.8 million peak kilowatts (kW) in 2021, from 21.8 million peak kW in 2020, based on data from our Annual Photovoltaic Module Shipments Report.
